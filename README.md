# TIMES-GEO

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/[...]

## Purpose of the model
The Global Energy Outlook (TIMES-GEO) model is an open-source, global energy system model covering energy systems dynamics for 31 regions of which 16 countries and 15 regional aggregates. The model has been developed by University College Cork and E4SMA in the context of the CHIMERA project , and released publicly under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-Share Alike 4.0 International Public License. The model finds the lowest-cost pathway to explore the evolution of the worldâ€™s energy system for electricity, transport, industry, buildings, energy-related agriculture, and novel fuels like hydrogen, e-fuels, and bioenergy to reduce emissions and meet mitigation targets

## Documentation
More information on the TIMES model generator and specific information about TIMES-GEO can be found in the [Documentation](....).

## About the developers
The list of developers, contributors and reviewers is described in the [Acknowledgements](/ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.md) section. 

TIMES-GEO has been developed by E4SMA S.r.l. and the MaREI Energy Policy and Modelling Group (EPMG) at University College Cork under the framework of the Chimera project (Multi-model innovations in Integrated Assessment Modelling of Global, Chinese, and Irish energy-economy-environment-climate systems investigating deep decarbonisation pathways from the Paris Agreement to the United Nations sustainable development goals) funded by the Science Foundation Ireland and National Science Foundation of China.

## Climate policy use
This model has been built to better inform increased global mitigation ambition.

## Scenario descriptions
At the moment no scenario cases have been applied to the model. 

## Peer-reviewed publications
A documentation paper is currently in preparation.
